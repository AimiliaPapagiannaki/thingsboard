The script nrg_autoreport_demo.py has been developed to serve as a monthly
report that can be generated after the user chooses a specific month. 
Energy, power and temperature are downloaded and preprocessed in order to 
create meaningful plots regarding the entire month.

The notebook Energy&powerAnalytics.ipynb contains many of the functions that
have been deployed in nrg_autoreport.py, only here there is no restriction
for taking only one month into account. This notebook is used to generate
reports related to the buildings of eSmartCity.
